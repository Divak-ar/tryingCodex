ABAP Internal Tables Best Practices

1. Use SORTED TABLE or HASHED TABLE when lookup speed matters.
2. For frequent key access, define a UNIQUE KEY if business rules allow it.
3. Avoid nested loops over large STANDARD TABLE objects when a key-based read can be used.
4. Use LOOP AT ... ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) to reduce copy overhead.
